NAVIMALL Project

This is my Software Engineering Web Application Project, this application is build on a Flask Python Framework and utilizes various 
APIs and a webcrawler to function. The objective of this application is build a single platform that connects shopping malls across Singapore
together and provides users a simple interface to search for malls and shop information that they desire.
