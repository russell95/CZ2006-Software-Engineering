# CZ2006-SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 
NAVIMALL Project

This is my Software Engineering Web Application Project, this application is build on a Flask Python Framework and utilizes various 
APIs and a webcrawler to function. The objective of this application is build a single platform that connects shopping malls across Singapore

together and provides users a simple interface to search for malls and shop information that they want. The application consist of 2 
platforms, the user and administrator platform. The user is able to query mall and shop information and as well as carpark availability 
of the mall and also in neighboring parking zones.

The administrator on the other hand is in charge of updating these malls and making minor or major changes on shops, another feature exclusive to the administrator would be the ability to web crawl, the web crawl feature explores scrapes mall names and respective information off Singapore's Street Directory Website and adds these information into our databases for user to view.
